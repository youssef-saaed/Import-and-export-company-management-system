1,Gemini LC Columns,Setting the Standard for pH Method Development Rugged reversed phase HPLC columns that offer extended lifetime under extreme pH conditions and excellent stability for reproducible high efficiency separations.,./media/Products img/Gemini LC Columns.png,13900,10,30 days,1100,1050
2,Cold Plate,MAS cold plate is holding a lot of cassettes on its large working surface 47cm*30cm. Cooling efficiency is important so the cold plate was designed with an environment adaptive control module to make sure the operating temperature is always stabilized at 35 °C under ambient. The MAS cold plate can be used as a stand-alone unit for re-cooling blocks prior to sectioning or as part of an embedding center to cool molds after paraffin dispensing.,./media/Products img/Cold Plate.jpeg,25200,55,30 days,1067,1054
3,Paraffin dispenser,Any histology lab must have paraffin wax in order to accomplish the sectioning process so that the lab operator is able to see the samples through a microscope. It is common to have a paraffin dispenser in this type of laboratory due to the importance of this consumable. Tissue processing is one of the most delicate techniques inside any kind of laboratory. ,./media/Products img/Paraffin dispenser.jpeg,5500,10,30 days,1100,1050
4,Grossing Station,The MAS Grossing Stations are custom built units that are plumbed for running tap water and vented for fume exhaust. The grossing stations are used as working stations for the gross analysis of tissue samples. The Grossing Stations offer the opportunity to customize agrossing station to fit a lab’s specific needs.,./media/Products img/Grossing Station.png,120000,55,30 days,1067,1054
5,Paraffin dispenser with Hot Plate,No description,./media/Products img/Paraffin dispenser with Hot Plate.jpeg,25000,10,30 days,1100,1050
6,Hot Plate 40cm*30cm,MAS Hot plates are frequently used in the laboratory to perform chemical reactions to heat samples and for numerous other activities. Hot plates are conceptually simple – a flat surface with heating elements. They do not produce open flames and are well suited for oil or sand bath use. But there are key considerations on the proper choice of hot plates and important safety factors that users should be aware of,./media/Products img/Hot Plate.jpeg,13000,55,30 days,1067,1054
7,Tissue float bath,Tissue float baths are used in histological and chemical and clinical and bacteriological laboratories for stretching and drying cut tissue samples. The exact temperature control of the MAS Hydro tissue float bath ensures evenly stretched sections that are clearly visible in the bath and guarantees gentle drying of the stretched sections on the heated edge.,./media/Products img/Tissue float bath.jpeg,11900,10,30 days,1100,1050
